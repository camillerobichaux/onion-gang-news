  <h1>Residents Report Mysterious Tuba Sounds at Night</h1>
  <p><em>By Ellis Babineaux | June 25, 2025</em></p>
  <p>Several Opelousas residents say they’ve heard haunting low brass notes echoing through their neighborhoods just after midnight for the past four nights. The source of the sounds remains unknown, sparking theories ranging from pranksters to paranormal activity.</p>
  <p>“At first I thought it was thunder, but then I heard it again. It was definitely a tuba. Real slow, real deliberate,” said Ernestine LeJeune, 72. “Like a sad parade was sneaking around.”</p>
  <p>Others reported hearing the sound near Bayou Teche and Oak Street, but no one has seen the musician.</p>
  <p>The Opelousas Police Department has received multiple non-emergency reports but has yet to identify a suspect. “We’re not ruling anything out,” said Officer Gerald Marks. “But we ain’t sending a SWAT team after a tuba.”</p>
  <p>Some locals suspect the same mysterious figure behind the infamous 'Accordion Phantom' hoax of 2019 may be returning with a new instrument.</p>
