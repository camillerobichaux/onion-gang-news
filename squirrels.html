  <h1>Why Are All the Town's Squirrels Missing?</h1>
  <p><em>By Casey Dugas | June 22, 2025</em></p>
  <p>Residents across Opelousas have noticed a strange silence in the trees — the squirrels are gone. Normally a staple of backyard scenes and park life, the furry acrobats seem to have vanished without a trace.</p>
  <p>“We used to have six or seven squirrels fighting over our pecan tree every morning. Haven’t seen a one in over a week,” said homeowner Blaine Richard. “It’s spooky.”</p>
  <p>Speculation is rampant. Some blame a surge in hawk activity, others whisper about environmental toxins or even supernatural forces. One local teen posted a TikTok suggesting the squirrels are staging a coordinated migration to Ville Platte.</p>
  <p>The Louisiana Department of Wildlife says no official study is underway, but encourages anyone with sightings (or suspicious lack thereof) to call their regional office.</p>
  <p>“Sometimes nature just moves on,” said wildlife officer Mandy Dupre. “Sometimes it takes the squirrels with it.”</p>
