  <h1>Crawfish Shortage Prompts Panic Buying at Opelousas Market</h1>
  <p><em>By Remy Hebert | June 27, 2025</em></p>
  <p>Local seafood vendors were overwhelmed Friday morning as residents rushed to secure what little crawfish remained in stock. The panic was sparked by rumors of a regional shortage fueled by unseasonably low water levels and a mysterious algae bloom affecting several Acadiana ponds.</p>
  <p>“We had folks lined up before we even opened. One guy offered to pay triple for a 10-pound sack,” said Danielle Thibodeaux, owner of Thib’s Boil Stop. “It was worse than Black Friday.”</p>
  <p>The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries issued a statement urging calm, but did not confirm whether the shortage would impact the upcoming Fourth of July weekend.</p>
  <p>Local meteorologist Gary Fontenot noted, “The drought conditions are real, but the algae reports haven’t been verified. Folks just need to simmer down and let the season do its thing.”</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, black market Facebook groups have reportedly seen a surge in crawfish barter posts. One user offered two sacks in exchange for a gently used riding mower.</p>
