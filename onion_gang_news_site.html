    <h1>'Onion Gang' Strikes Again in Opelousas</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Camille Robichaux | June 28, 2025</p>

    <p>Residents in the normally quiet town of Opelousas, Louisiana, are on edge after a string of bizarre incidents linked to a group dubbed the “Onion Gang.” According to multiple reports, unknown individuals have been leaving raw onions inside open mailboxes—a move that locals believe may signal future criminal targeting.</p>
    <p>“I walked outside to check my mail and there it was—just one red onion sitting there. The box was wide open like they wanted me to see it,” said longtime resident Loretta Boudreaux. “I didn’t know what to do. I closed the mailbox and called the sheriff.”</p>
    <p>The St. Landry Parish Sheriff's Office issued a brief statement Monday: "We are aware of reports of suspicious produce left in residential mailboxes. At this time, we cannot confirm any criminal intent. The matter is under review."
    </p>
    <p>This is not the first time Opelousas has dealt with vegetable-based intimidation. In 2017, a rash of sweet potato placements caused minor alarm in a neighboring parish. But experts say the onion has a more symbolic meaning. "Onions can represent layers and hidden agendas," said Dr. Charmaine Gautreaux, a folklorist at LSU-Eunice. “There’s an eerie undertone to this.”</p>
    <p>Local officials urge residents not to touch any suspicious vegetables and to report incidents to law enforcement immediately.</p>
